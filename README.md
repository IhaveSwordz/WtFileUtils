# WtFileUtils
A module with a set of file utils for extracting and viewing various warthunder file file types










# Credits
alot of the code here was reverse engineered from the efforts of the people over at 
https://github.com/Warthunder-Open-Source-Foundation 

Without their efforts, I would have had to attempt to reverse engineer Gaijins source code over at https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/DagorEngine
, which does not sound like a fun time, so thank you to them for their hard work

# Notes
if you are looking for a blk / VROMFs unpacker, this is not the place to be. While this project can do so, it will 
not have overhead for cli builtin. This project is more suited to be integrated into projects for VROMFs and blk support.

for a easy-to-use unpacker go look over at https://github.com/Warthunder-Open-Source-Foundation/wt_ext_cli
